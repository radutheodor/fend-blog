        The economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic could claim up to three million jobs by the summer, according
        to the Economic Policy Institute. "At this point, a coronavirus recession is inevitable. But the policy response
        can determine how deep it is, how long it lasts, and how rapidly the economy bounces back from it," wrote EPI
        Director of Research Josh Bivens. A policy response with enough fiscal stimulus could help curtail the number of
        jobs lost, Bivens said. Moderate stimulus isn't enough, he warned, and could still allow for three million lost
        jobs.
