            The economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic could claim up to three million jobs by the summer, according to the Economic Policy Institute. "At this point, a coronavirus recession is inevitable. But the policy response can determine how deep it is, how long it lasts, and how
            rapidly the economy bounces back from it," wrote EPI Director of Research Josh Bivens. A policy response with enough fiscal stimulus could help curtail the number of jobs lost, Bivens said.

            Microsoft revealed the technical specifications of its next generation video game console, the Xbox Series X, in a Monday blog post. Although pricing is still unknown, Microsoft said the Series X is coming this holiday season and has several new features that would give it a leg up over
            older consoles. The Series X will be capable of running 4K graphics at 60 to 120 frames per second, meaning that game graphics should display clear details and games will appear smooth.

            "Hey folks. Good News: One week after testing Positive, in self-isolation, the symptoms are much the same," Hanks wrote in the caption of a photo showing his antique Corona typewriter. "No fever but the blahs. Folding the laundry and doing the dishes leads to a nap on the couch." On
            Monday it was announced that the couple had been released from a Queensland hospital and gone into self-quarantine. Tuesday Hanks joked about the downside of their togetherness.

          <p class="date">March 17, 2020</p>
          <p class="info">
            Former Vice President Joe Biden has a near-insurmountable lead over Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders after sweeping Tuesday's primaries in Arizona, Florida and Illinois. Now, the question is whether the Democratic primary arrives at a swift end in the coming days or continue on longer, as
            states that haven't yet voted shift their primaries into early June amid the coronavirus pandemic. In a live-streamed video from his home in Delaware, Biden sounded like he believed what the delegate math makes clear: He had sewn up the Democratic nomination. He said he and Sanders share
            a "common vision" and told the Vermont senator's young supporters: "I hear you."

          <p class="info">
            UEFA has decided to postpone this year's European Championship until 2021 because of the ongoing coronavirus outbreak. The football tournament had been due to kick off in Rome, Italy, on June 12 and was to be played in 12 different host cities across the continent. At an emergency
            meeting Tuesday, European football's governing body ruled the competition will now be played between June 11 to July 11 next year, allowing time for domestic competitions to conclude.

            The No Child Left Behind law requires schools to meet annual goals largely based on student test scores. When schools fail to make "adequate yearly progress," the law assigns them a label and requires them to take certain corrective steps
